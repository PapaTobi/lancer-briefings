# Hercynia Distress Signal
## Initial Tasking Packet
# Union Intelligence
- Distress call received 2 Standard Months ago from **EVERGREEN**, a colony on the planet **HERCYNIA** in the **ATLAS** line, seeking aid against unidentified aggressors.
- **EVERGREEN** is under the administration of **LANDMARK COLONIAL**, a minor subsidiary corporation of **SMITH-SHIMANO CORPRO.** First objective is to make contact with local **LC** Representative and integrate into the local hierarchy.
- Situation on-ground is to be treated with utmost care. Recent investigation suggests possibility of extant human populations on **HERCYNIA** unreported by **LC**. Ground Team is advised not to reveal these suspicions to **LC** Personnel unless deemed necessary.
- Further research has yielded little information about **HERCYNIA'S** history prior to founding of **EVERGREEN**. Data suggests **HERCYNIA** was once subject to widespread and catastrophic military action by **SECCCOMM**, though records lack meaningful detail. Recent scans show large irradiated zones on planetary surface, as well as decayed and encrypted communications broadcasting on-loop. Ground team should expect to encounter remnants of **SECCOMM** presence: unexploded ordnance, waste radiation, and potentially even derelict military installations.

# Goals
- Familiarize with the Union Tasking Packet.
- Warm-up in the Gibraltar's virtual training space. (Optional)
