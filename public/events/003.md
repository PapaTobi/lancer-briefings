# Evergreen // Early Summer, 5014u
At the onset of Summer and at the end of a long period of peace and quiet within **EVERGREEN**, the **MYSTERIOUS SIGNAL** is broadcasted again, affecting robots by the masses and directing them to march to the East. **PATIENCE** requested that **SMC** follow the machines to their destination and investigate the origins of the **SIGNAL**.
