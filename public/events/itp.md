# Light Carrier Gibraltar // Early Spring, 5014u
After a month-long trip, the **GIBRALTAR** has ferried the members of **STARSPEAR MERCENARY COMPANY** from the nearest public blinkship to the confines of the **ARDENNES-3** system. They received a transmission from **UNION** containing some information on **HERCYNIA**, the colony of **EVERGREEN**, and the distress call that the company has chosen to answer.

While in transit towards the world, the group accepted an offer from the **GIBRALTAR'S** captain to warm up in a virtual training scenario. They packed up and were sent to land by the colony of **EVERGREEN** via autoshuttle shortly afterwards.

Once one the ground, the members of **SMC** were greeted by the commander of **EVERGREEN'S** militia, **BRAVA HADURA**. Informing them of a **SNIPER** looming over the area, they cautiously were brought to the colony's administrative heart, the **GOVERNOR'S FARM**. There, they met the NHP administrator **PATIENCE**, who informed them of their first assignment.
