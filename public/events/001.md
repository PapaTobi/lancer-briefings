Within the **GOVERNOR'S FARM**, the **SMC** learned of **EVERGREEN'S** growing problem with unknown aggressors. While rumored by much of the colony to be a group of indigenous insectoid lifeforms known as **EGREGORIANS**, **PATIENCE** believes them to be nothing more than a group of pirates and claim jumpers seeking to exploit them. 

Thus, the group was offered to pick between two time-critical assignments: to either escort a convoy of **CASTOR FIELDING'S** engineering team to drain the landing bowl, or to track down the **SNIPER TEAM** harassing the colony. The **SMC** decided that they would accept the former.
