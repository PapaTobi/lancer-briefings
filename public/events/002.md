# Evergreen // Late Spring, 5014u
The weeks of Spring passed, with the hot and humid Summer approaching on the horizon. **SMC** was summoned to Evergreen's Council Chambers to attend a meeting with the colony's leadership. After going over the mercenary group's work in helping the colony since they've arrived, Patience informed the council of reports that activity has increased near Evergreen's border. Putting the colony at maximum security level, he asks SMC to remain on high alert and stay within the colony while Militia scouts try and track the raiders.
