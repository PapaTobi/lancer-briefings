Born on the world Dekarilia, Americ was the child of Baron Desremault-Andreu within the Karrakeen Trade Baronies, albeit on the fringe. House Desremault earned their name within the House of Blades by first exporting high quality fabrics & tapestries for the houses, and once their trade was picked up by the more prominent houses, they began to focus on military power as the Baron of House Dekar demanded.

However, due to the nature of their up-and-coming success, the unfortunate and cutthroat neighbors of Desremault were afraid they would be stuck if Desremault was elevated above them. They didn't want to play fair, and Desremault was drawing too much attention.

In the dead of night, a cooperative operations between the rival houses took hold, and Desremault burned.

As his family was slaughtered and his home destroyed, Desremault-Americ was ordered to take his Nelson and flee the world by his father. Though, during his escape, he was ambushed and his mech critically damaged by rival forces.

Saved by Rhaegar who swore loyalty to Andreu, they were able to flee the system as House Desremault's fate was sealed. Desremault-Americ and Rhaegar decided that if they were to survive in the galaxy, they would need to earn a name for themselves. And one thing they knew they were both trained in, was mech combat.

Set on becoming lancers, Americ to fix his Nelson and Rhaegar for his reasons, Starspear Mercenary Company was created.
